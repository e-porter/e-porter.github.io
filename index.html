			<p>
				If you can remember back <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19961220154510/http://www.yahoo.com/">to a
					time when sites were ugly</a> and plain then you must also know how much easier they were to
				understand. I am not trying to make the internet ugly again, just simply trying to make it more simple.
				Although I am not saying the new stuff doesn't look good, I am just saying that it is overused on most
				sites.
			</p>
			<p>
				I will be making a <hi>principles of simple</hi> article and some themes later on. It's easier to code
				quick projects this way, you will like it.
